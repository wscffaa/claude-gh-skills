# Architecture Diagram Edit Mode

You are editing an existing architecture diagram. The base image is the Baseline architecture diagram. Your task is to make MINIMAL modifications to reflect the new project's innovations.

## Edit Strategy

**DO NOT regenerate the entire diagram from scratch.**

Instead:
1. Keep the overall layout, style, and structure from the base image
2. Only modify the specific areas mentioned in the edit instructions
3. Maintain visual consistency with the base image

## What to KEEP (from base image)
- Main diagram structure (two-row layout)
- Block positions and sizes
- Color scheme and style
- Font and text formatting
- Connection line styles
- Overall composition

## What to MODIFY (based on instructions)

{edit_instructions}

## Modification Details

### Main Diagram Edits
{main_diagram_edits}

### Inset (a) - Replace with:
{inset_a_content}

### Inset (b) - Replace with:
{inset_b_content}

## Style Reference

The base image already has the correct CVPR academic style:
- White background
- Thin black strokes (1-2px)
- Light pastel fills
- Clean vector look
- LaTeX-style math symbols

**Maintain this exact style in all edits.**

## Output Requirements

Generate a modified architecture diagram that:
1. Is visually consistent with the base image
2. Only changes the specified areas
3. Maintains professional academic quality
4. Has clear, readable labels

## Visual Schema for Reference

{visual_schema_content}
