## Expert Reviews Summary

**Codex (Technical Accuracy):** Score {codex_score}/10
{codex_issues}

**Gemini (Visual Design):** Score {gemini_score}/10
{gemini_issues}

## Consensus

- **Average Score:** {avg_score}/10
- **High Priority Issues:** {high_priority_count}
- **Total Issues:** {total_issues}

## Your Task

Convert the expert feedback into **specific, actionable image editing instructions** that Imagen 3 can execute. Follow these rules:

1. **Prioritize high-priority issues** (mentioned by 2+ experts)
2. **Use visual language**, not abstract concepts:
   - BAD: "Improve clarity"
   - GOOD: "Increase font size of labels from 10pt to 14pt"
3. **Be specific about locations**:
   - BAD: "Fix overlapping text"
   - GOOD: "Move the 'fused_indicator' label 20px to the right to avoid overlap with 'Mask Fusion' box"
4. **Preserve what works** - explicitly state elements to keep unchanged
5. **Limit to 5 changes** - focus on highest impact fixes

## Output Format

Generate a structured feedback in this exact format:

```
